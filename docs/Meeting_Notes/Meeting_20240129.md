   - Discussion on using the Intel compiler and other new sets of compilers.
   - Mention of GCC and MPI F90 compilers, highlighting the importance of choosing one and sticking to it for consistency.

   - The need to delete and recompile in certain scenarios was highlighted.
   - Configuration of the compilation environment, including handling of libraries and dependencies, was discussed.
## Management Project 
   - Emphasis on the importance of organizing and managing code and library files.
   - Discussion on proper management and storage of code in project repositories.
   - Importance of separating source code from compiled binaries was stressed.
## To Do
1. Nancy continues to work on configuring the necessary libraries and dependencies and try to run the code and explore it. 
2. Nancy prepares for the next meeting with updates on progress and any new issues encountered.
