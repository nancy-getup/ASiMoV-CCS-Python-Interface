# Key Points Discussed: 
 - I showed the problem that I met when I writing the fortran code. The supervisor help me solve it, and also explained the difference between parallel and shared environment and shared memory management in parallel environments using a shared environment to reduce memory consumption. 
 - The supervisor said that because the python can not create the type `par_env` of parameter so this parameter should be created in the fortran, which means it needs a wrapper function. 
 - After finishing the code, the correctness of modified subroutine should be validate, comparing with running original test case with same parameters, as a result, we can know the correctness of the modified subroutine.
 - As for the performance testing, I should test the python code by running Slurm with different parameters. 
 - Completing the project within tight deadlines and limited resources.

# To Do 
- Remove environment arguments from run_tgv() function to allow calling it from Python 
- Run original TGV test case from Fortran with same parameters as modified test case run from Python, to validate results are the same 
- Have Python be able to call CCS and run the TGV case from CCS by next Thursday
- Introduce parameters to the Python interface to allow setting time step, grid size, etc
