# Key Points Discussed:

- Optimising Simulation Settings for Accuracy and Time  
	- Suggested plotting accuracy vs. time to find the optimal simulation settings for a given error level  
	- Explained how to analyse this plot to determine the optimal parameter combination that achieves the target error in the minimum time
- Using Pareto Front Analysis to Optimise Run Time and Error  
	- Recommended plotting time vs. computational resources (e.g., CPU hours) to more fairly evaluate the cost of running the simulations  
	- Explained the concept of Pareto front analysis, which optimizes two objectives (error and time) simultaneously  
	- Demonstrated how to analyze the Pareto front curve to find the optimal trade-off point between the two objectives  
	- Discussed the characteristics of the optimal points on the Pareto front, such as the relationship between CPS and DT  
	- Proposed the idea of using multiple error metrics (e.g., errors in U and V directions) for a more comprehensive analysis
- Implementing CFD Code and Explaining CCS and DT  
	- Recommended providing detailed explanations of CFD simulation concepts and key parameters in the "Background" section  
	- Differentiated between "Introduction" and "Background," noting that the Background should provide more contextual information  
	- Emphasized the importance of explaining the methodology and variable definitions
- Implementing a Simulation Sequence Using Python, Fortran, and CCS  
	- Described the methodological and implementation process of using Python, Fortran, and CCS to run the simulation sequence  
	- Discussed how to organize the code structure for an AI project, including the literature review in the Methodology section  
	- Explained the rationale for recommending the use of Python for data science tasks
- Using Slurm and Python for Parallel Computing, Discussing Limitations and Solutions  
	- Mentioned the issues encountered when using Python in their Slurm script  
	- Suggested using Python to handle the logic for the Fortran interface, citing the ease of writing different inputs and logic  
	- Discussed the necessity of initialization and finalization to address certain cases
- Project Progress, Deadlines, and Meeting Schedules  
	- Discussed the lessons learned from the project, including the importance of planning and time management  
	- Recommended sending materials early to allow the advisor sufficient time for review  
	- Planned to schedule a mid-week check-in meeting to discuss progress

# To Do:  
1. Write the Background section, providing detailed explanations of CFD simulation concepts and parameters  
2. Compose the Methodology section, reviewing the selection of analysis tools and methods  
3. Thoroughly describe the code structure and mechanisms in the Implementation section  
4. Add a "Lessons Learned" and "Future Work" section
