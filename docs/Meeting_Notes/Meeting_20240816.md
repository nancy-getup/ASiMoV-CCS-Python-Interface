# Key Points Discussed:
    1. Using Python for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulations and Optimization
    - The TGV (Taylor-Green Vortex) test case is commonly used to test the accuracy of CFD solutions
    - The TGV case has a known exact analytical solution, allowing the numerical solution to be directly compared and the error quantified
    - Using the TGV case helps evaluate the accuracy of the CFD implementation, which is important for the optimization work
    - The speaker explains that the TGV case is used because "we have the exact solution, so we can compare against that. And that's how you get the error."
    - The speaker discusses the ease of using Python compared to Fortran for these types of computational tasks, citing the flexibility and ability to leverage other Python tools

    2. Improving the Performance of a Machine Learning Model
    - The speaker focuses on accurately describing the performance and accuracy trade-offs of the machine learning model
    - The discussion suggests explaining the process of calling the Fortran code from Python, rather than showing the actual code
    - There is a focus on ensuring the presentation slides are legible, with suggestions to increase font sizes for labels and legends
    - The speaker investigates discrepancies in accuracy between single-node and two-node models, which is an area that requires further investigation

    3. Improving Neural Network Performance for Image Classification
    - The discussion centers around analyzing the performance and scalability of the neural network model
    - The suggestion is to create a plot focused solely on performance metrics, without including accuracy, to better understand the scalability
    - The speakers also discuss generalizing the interface to handle different test cases, rather than being hardcoded for a specific case

    4. Miscellaneous Topics
    - The speakers discuss modifying code and adding music to slides
    - There are also discussions about cleaning up after a party and playing a game called "covid" with a brother

# To Do:
1. Modify the conclusion slide to avoid repeating content from previous slides.
2. Add a performance-only plot (without accuracy) to allow for a scalability analysis.
