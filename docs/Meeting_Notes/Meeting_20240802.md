# Key Points Discussed:

-  Numerical Approximation in CFD Simulations  
	- Discussed the importance of changing the time step (Δt) to accurately represent the number of steps in the numerical integration.  
	- Explained how to use conventional Δt to solve the CFD problem, setting a time limit of 0.5 seconds.  
	- Talked about the relationship between time step and number of iterations (n) in the numerical integration.

- Running Simulations for Fluid Dynamics  
	- Discussed using different cell sizes and simulated time periods for the CFD simulations.  
	- Estimated the optimal number of cells for the mesh generation, ranging from 10,000 to 1 million.  
	- Discussed modifying the job to reduce cost, considering hardware configurations and budget constraints.

- Numerical Differentiation and Error Analysis  
	- Discussed calculating error in the simulations and plotting cost vs. number of steps for a given grid.  
	- Struggled to understand how to properly calculate the error in the simulation.

- Computational Cost and Grid Size  
	- Explained how solving equations can be simplified by visualizing a grid of cells.  
	- Discussed determining the number of equations to solve based on the problem size.  
	- Discussed issues with the Slurm scripts, reports, and time steps.

# To Do:  
1. Run simulations with smaller grid sizes up to 1600 cells and collect the cost data.  
2. Plot the cost vs. the number of equations solved to analyze how the different parameters influence the performance.  
3. Adjust the Slurm scripts as discussed and send them.  
4. Send the draft report section to the supervisor for feedback.  
5. Request additional budget from the computing resources to continue the simulations.
