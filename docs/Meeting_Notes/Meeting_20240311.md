# Meeting Notes 
Date: 2024-03-11

## Key Points Discussed:
1. File Accessibility Issues:

Challenges encountered with file accessibility; a previously working file is now not found.
Speculation on potential causes including path or location issues.
2. Compilation and Tooling:

Discussion on the compilation process, specifically compiling with CCS and the necessity to test with different compilers, including GFortran.
3. Python Integration and Data Structures:

Detailed exploration of using Python for handling vector operations and the importance of testing with different data structures like arrays and custom-defined vector types.
Challenges with allocatable types in Fortran highlighted.
4. Comparative Analysis:

Main differences between F2Py and another unspecified tool were discussed, focusing on features, capabilities, and subroutine handling from Fortran to Python.
5. Compiler Compatibility:

The need to ensure compatibility across various compilers (GFortran, Intel, Cray) was stressed, indicating a broader testing scope to ensure functionality.
6. Optimization and Testing:

Extensive discussion on optimization techniques, parameter testing, and the exploration of different values and quantities to achieve optimal performance.
7. Utilizing Machine Learning:

Potential use of machine learning for automating parameter optimization was discussed, suggesting an innovative approach to finding optimal simulation settings.
8. Project Documentation and Management:

Strategies for conducting a literature review, managing project documentation, and the importance of proper citation.
Use of project management tools (e.g., GitHub issues) to organize tasks and document progress.
9. Report Structure and Milestones:

Outline of the report structure including background information, investigation details, and proposal for future work.
Discussion on setting milestones, defining success criteria, and incorporating machine learning or statistical analysis into the project.
10. Future Directions:

Consideration of using machine learning for data analysis and optimization, with a focus on learning more about suitable tools and methods.
Finalizing the project plan with clear milestones and success criteria based on the discussion.

## To Do
- Troubleshoot and resolve the file accessibility issue.
