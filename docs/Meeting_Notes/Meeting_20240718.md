# Key Points Discussed: 
 - Discuss which method is suitable for the project. I wrote some new subroutines in Fortran to read argument from Python in Fortran and then set the value to the parameters in Fortran. But the supervisor suggests passing the parameters in python code directly instead of command line arguments.
- Debugging a Python and Fortran code. 
	- During the coding progress, I found the Fortran code with Python interface was hard to debug directly and I ask how can I do. 
	- The supervisor suggested that printing statements and using a debugger tool, like gdb, maybe can help identify the error. 
	- And the supervisor also provide a the command line for makefile in debug version which can help the compiler find more insidious errors in code.
- Discuss about the report. I ask some problem about the report, for example, what the different between Technical approach and Description of the project work conducted. And the supervisor gave me lots of suggestions and ideas about it.

# To Do 
- Remove environment arguments (par_env, shared_env) from run_tgv() function to allow calling it from Python 
- Run original TGV test case from Fortran with same parameters as modified test case run from Python, to validate results are the same 
- Have Python be able to call CCS and run the TGV case from CCS by next Thursday
- Introduce parameters to the Python interface to allow setting time step, grid size, etc
