# Key Points Discussed: 
- Using Python and Fortran for scientific computing, with mentions of CCS and F2PI. We discussed using Python and Fortran to run a code, with success in compiling and linking but complexity in using CCS. 
- Compiling code using CCS and Fortran, testing module creation. Speaker 1 explained how to use makefiles to compile code with flexibility and efficiency. Speaker 1 suggested using a module file to compile code and create a new line. 
- Using MPI and Fortran for parallel computing in Python. Speaker 1 suggested using timers in CS to integrate with CCS and discussed differences between running code in Python vs MPI. 
# To Do 
- Create a new folder within an existing CCS case for the Fortran code. Add F2Py compilation lines to the makefile. 
- Modify the Fortran code to use the CCS timers module for timing instead of MPI. Compile and run to test integration.  
- Research makefile syntax in more detail if needed for compilation. Online tutorials were recommended.
