# Key Points Discussed: 
 - Discussed using Python to run one of CFD simulation cases, TGV, and return timing and error metrics for benchmarking. 
	 - The supervisor explained the difference between L2 norm error and L-infinity norm error 
	 - The supervisor gave the advice about which parameters should be set in the python or fortran and what the result should be returned. 
	 - We discussed about the benchmarking data in Python, for example, what data should be analysed to understand solver performance at different problems sizes/configurations.
- Discussed about the dissertation report, so that I can understand the criteria deeply. 
	- The supervisor explained how to write the motivation and context according to the literature review rather than rewriting it. 
	- The supervisor explained the difference between 'Technical approach' and 'Description of the project work conducted' and gave the advice how to write these parts. 
	- The supervisor highlight the importance of updating gitlab regularly.  
# To Do 
- Try running actual CCS solver code 'runtgv' from Python interface instead of just timer test code, and record the result (time and error data) as the benchmarking data. 
- Combine two makefiles used for compilation into a single makefile.
- Regularly committing code changes using Git version control.
