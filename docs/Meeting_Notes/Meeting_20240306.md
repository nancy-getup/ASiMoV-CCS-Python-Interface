# Key Points Discussed:
1. **Demo Code Approach:**
   - The initial approach of using simple code with int passing for testing the suitability of each method was discussed. It was noted that this approach was too simplistic.
   - **Feedback:** The teacher recommended writing the demo code as a subroutine rather than a function to allow for more flexibility in testing. It was suggested to pass a variety of values to thoroughly test the methods, highlighting the importance of not relying on the original code. Instead, a simpler version should be crafted for testing purposes.
2. **Exploration of Methods:**
   - Several methods that require the use of C as an intermediate layer between Fortran and Python were introduced.
   - **Feedback:** The teacher acknowledged the use of C as an intermediate layer as a viable option but also suggested it might be insufficient for comprehensive integration testing. The recommendation was to explore `gfort2py` as an alternative, which allows for direct connectivity between Fortran and Python without the necessity for a C layer.

# To Do
 - **Development of Demo Code:** Write new demo code that incorporates the feedback, focusing on subroutines and the passing of diverse types of data to evaluate the methods' suitability more effectively.
 - **Testing with Different Data Types:** Ensure the demo code is capable of handling various data types to assess the methods' versatility and reliability.
 - **Exploration of `gfort2py`:** Investigate the use of `gfort2py` for direct Fortran to Python integration, as this could offer a more streamlined approach than using C as an intermediary.
