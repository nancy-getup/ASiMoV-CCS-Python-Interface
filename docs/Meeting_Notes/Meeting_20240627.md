# Key Points Discussed: 
- We talking about the difference between CMake and Makefile as the wrapper for CSS, and the supervisor said that the CMake also can be written by Makefile and the CCS is used the Makefile, therefore using Makefile is the better choice for this project. 
- Creating a dynamic link library for a CCS project is important in this project. The speakers discussed adding a library to the makefile for code reuse, therefore, the makefile should be modified to generate a dynamic library instead of a static one. They suggested using shared library instead of error message to create dynamic CCS. 
- The supervisor suggested to use GitHub to manage code and track progress for a project and track of project progress, timeline and next steps. 
# To Do 
- Create a simple makefile to compile the example code from the CMake page as a test. 
- And then modify the makefile to call CCS libraries. 
- Look over the report requirements document ahead of the next meeting. 
- Consider using GitHub more consistently to track progress.
