# Key Points Discussed:

1. **Background and Experience**:
   - Sebastien has a background in CFD development related to HPC, with experience in MPI and OpenMP.
   - Nancy has an undergraduate background in digital media and has experience using Python, which led to choosing this project.

2. **Project Overview**:
   - The project goal is to develop a Python interface ASiMoV-CCS a CFD and combustion code to allow for flexible parameter setting and test case runs.
   - The software currently allows for various test cases but lacks flexibility, requiring manual setup or scripting for different parameters.

3. **Technical Challenges and Requirements**:
   - Understanding and running the existing Fortran code.
   - Integrating Python and Fortran to enable communication between the two.
   - Handling and modifying configuration files, especially YAML files, which define simulation parameters and boundary conditions.

4. **Dependency Installation Issues**:
   - Nancy faced challenges installing required dependencies for the code. And Sebastien plans to provide scripts to assist with the installation process.

5. **Future Steps and Exploration**:
   - First, focus on resolving dependency installation issues.
   - Begin exploring how to integrate Python with the Fortran code.
   - Read the provided CFD-related materials to better understand the project's technical aspects and it is important for modifying the code in the future. 
   - Weekly meetings planned for progress tracking and issue resolution.


# To Do:
1. Nancy continues to work on installing and configuring the necessary libraries and dependencies.
2. Nancy prepares for the next meeting with updates on progress and any new issues encountered.
