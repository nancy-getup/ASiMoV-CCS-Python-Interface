# Key Points Discussed:
- Discussion about the future use of multi-processing and MPI communications in Python and Fortran for parallel processing, specifically within the context of the CCS code.
- Various coding topics were mentioned including the need for integration of MPI communications in the Fortran code to allow for proper parallel processing and data communication across different processes.
- Specific challenges with current threading configurations and the need for MPI implementation to support multiple node operations were outlined.
- Proposed solutions include running Python code with MPI to call Fortran routines and ensuring that the Fortran part handles the parallelization efficiently.
- Discussion about reusing existing code and creating small test cases to check MPI communications.
- Future steps include simplifying Python integration, focusing on MPI communication testing, and adapting existing Fortran codes to better integrate with Python scripts for parallel execution.

# To Do:
- Implement and test MPI communications in the Fortran code.
- Create small test cases to verify the correct functioning of MPI communications.
- Integrate Python code with MPI to call Fortran routines and manage parallel executions.
