# Key Points Discussed:
1. **Project Overview Order**: Discussed the appropriate order for the project overview in the presentation: first introduce the background of the project and then going to the description of project is better and smooth for users so that they can understand the project and some terminology. And the supervisor suggested focusing more on showcasing outcomes rather than processes in the proof-of-concept section.
2. **Emphasizing Challenges and its fallback plan**: The discussion emphasized the need to focus more on challenges associated with MPI in parallel computing during the presentation, because it is the main challenge in the next stage. According to the challenges, the supervisor also gave a suggestion of fallback plan to use the subprocess module which is not very good but can implement the project. 
3. **Presentation Confidence**: Expressed concerns about my confidence in delivering the presentation smoothly. The supervisor recommended extensive practice to internalize the script, which would enhance fluency and confidence during the final presentation.
4. **Handling Questions**: The supervisor noted that it's okay not to know the answer to every question from the audience. Acknowledging gaps and promising to address them in future work can be an effective way to handle such situations.

# To Do

- **Modify the slides**: According to the supervisor's advice, modify the initial slides to better order the project overview and emphasize outcomes in the proof-of-concept section.
- **Practice the presentation**: Repeatedly practice the presentation to ensure smooth delivery and boost confidence.
