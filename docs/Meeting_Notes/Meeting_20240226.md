# Key Points Discussed:

1. **Understanding the TGV Test Case**:
   - The TGV (Taylor-Green Vortex) test case is a fundamental pattern used for numerical computation testing, involving fluid dynamics simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations. It's characterized by its simplicity, using sinusoidal and cosinusoidal functions, which makes mathematical manipulations straightforward.

2. **Simulation Process Overview**:
   - Detailed explanation of the simulation process, including setting up the computational domain, defining initial conditions, time stepping, and boundary conditions. The discussion emphasized the importance of the time step size and the iterative solution approach for advancing the simulation through discrete time steps.

3. **Error Calculation and Analysis**:
   - The procedure for calculating the error between the computed solution and the exact analytical solution was explained. Two types of errors, L2 norm and infinity norm, were discussed to assess the accuracy of the simulation results.

4. **Configuration and Initialization**:
   - Configuration of the simulation involves specifying parameters like the size of the computational domain and the time step. The discussion highlighted how initial conditions are set up and the significance of boundary conditions in defining the flow characteristics at the domain edges.

5. **Python Interface for Simulation**:
   - The project aims to develop a Python interface to configure and run simulations, moving away from YAML file configurations. This approach would enable more dynamic and programmable simulation setups and facilitate easier integration and automation of simulation workflows.

6. **Literature Review for Python-Fortran Integration**:
   - A literature review is needed to explore existing methods for integrating Python with Fortran, focusing on identifying the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. This review will inform the development of the Python interface for the project.

# To Do:

1. **Deepen Understanding of CFD Concepts**:
   - Continue exploring the TGV test case and the fundamental concepts of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to gain a better understanding of the simulation process and its components.

2. **Conduct a Literature Review**:
   - Perform a literature review on Python-Fortran integration methods. Identify and analyze existing solutions to determine the most suitable approach for developing the Python interface for the simulation project.

3. **Develop a Proof of Concept**:
   - Create a simple proof of concept for the Python interface by starting with a basic Fortran module that can interact with Python. This module should mimic the structure of the full simulation code but on a much simpler scale.

4. **Prepare for Report and Presentation**:
   - Prepare for the feasibility study report and project pitch 
   - At the same, begin preparing for the upcoming presentation by organizing the findings.
