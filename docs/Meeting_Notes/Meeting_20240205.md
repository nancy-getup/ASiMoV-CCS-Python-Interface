# Key Points Discussed:

1. **Compilation Issues:**
    - Encountered issues with CCS definitions, highlighting the need to compile all related files.
    - Discussed handling of binary files, emphasizing the correct way to add their PATH to the system's PATH for accessibility by all tools.
    - Mentioned the significance of cleaning (make clean) and recompiling for dealing with dependency and version mismatch issues.
2. **Environment Configuration and File Paths:**
    - Guided the student on properly configuring the PATH environment variable by removing unnecessary path segments to ensure only folder paths are added.
    - Discussed how to manage and modify existing environment variables and reference files and tools through them correctly.
3. **Environment Setup and Troubleshooting:**
    - Addressed specific issues encountered during environment setup, such as installing and configuring the YAML library and dealing with version compatibility issues.
    - Instructed on deleting and recreating the Python virtual environment, as well as correctly installing and updating dependency libraries.
# To Do
1. The supervisor said he will provide the new scripts to instal `fyaml-c library` and Nancy continues to finish the configuration. And then try to run the code. 
2. The supervisor suggested Nancy begin exploring how to call Fortran code from Python as part of the project.
    - Discussed starting with simple Fortran code to avoid dealing directly with complex systems and libraries at the outset.
